Alter Ego Optics: 
Description:

So far, this is just the beginnings of an idea of a program. I am new to programming. I am currently learning Kotlin via JetBrains Academy. I am noob as noob can be. GitHub seems to be the place to go to learn, create and contribute to all things programming. This is just going to be a side project that I will only be working on from time to time as I learn how to become a programmer. This is where it says to start so here I am. Lol...thats all I got so far. At least until I learn how to use github some more.
